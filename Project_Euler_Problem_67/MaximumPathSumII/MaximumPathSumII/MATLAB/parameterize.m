function [R_] = parameterize(R_)

    % We need to reparameterize exponential space into an optimum
    % sub-space distribution of Lagrangians to use in tandem with 
    % the field of directives in p-adic space.

    % This will enable further efficiency by reducing the search space to
    % fewer and lesser convolutional binary groups, especially when the 
    % search space is large.

    % From here, we are able to span forward and back ward linear sweeps 
    % across all observations almost simultaneously.
